# My First HTML Project

This is my very first HTML practice project. It's a simple web page created to understand the basic structure of HTML, including tags like:

- `<html>`
- `<head>` and `<title>`
- `<body>`, `<h1>`, and `<p>`

## 🛠️ What I Learned
- How to structure an HTML document
- How to use heading and paragraph tags
- Pushing code to GitHub!

## 📁 Files
